# IaC - 101 for AWS

This is just for educational purposes, just barely scratch the surface

## Pre-requisite and assumption

Both opentofu and aws-cli binary is already installed for your operating system and aws-cli is already configured, if not see below

```python
# Your Access Key and Secret is only available after you enable and activate your account in AWS, it takes 24 hours so be patient
# In your operating system terminal 'aws configure'

AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Default region name [None]: ap-southeast-1
Default output format [None]: json

```
always terminate your ec2 instance after use to avoid incurred charges on your CC
